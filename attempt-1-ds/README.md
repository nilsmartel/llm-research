This implementation includes:

    Token embeddings for a vocabulary of size 128

    Positional embeddings

    A simple transformer block with self-attention

    A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for transformations

    Layer normalization

    Training utilities

To use this:

    The model expects input as token indices (1-128)

    It outputs logits over the vocabulary

    The train! function handles training with cross-entropy loss

    The generate function can produce new sequences

Note that this is a simplified implementation. A production-ready LLM would include:

    More sophisticated attention mechanisms

    Better positional embeddings

    More layers and parameters

    Proper batching and data loading

    Regularization techniques

    More advanced training procedures

You can adjust the hyperparameters at the top of the file to change the model size and behavior.
